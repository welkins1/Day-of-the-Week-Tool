# Day-of-the-Week-Tool
This is my first GitHub repo upload that showcases a basic program I made. 

It's very basic and allows someone to determine what day of the week it will be after x amount of days from a selected day of the week. 

I made this program to work on some of the skills I learned so far in my intro CompSci class. At the time of posting this GitHub, I haven't learned loops or catch statements in my class yet, so I had to research on how to implement those in my program. 

The while loop was easy to learn, but the catch statements were tricky as I really needed to pay attention to what I put inside and outside of the statement. 

I kept running into a problem where if I spammed invalid input, the output would be blank for a little bit and eventually crash. This was because of a System.out.println method being under the else statement and within the boundaries of the catch statement. 

I also didn't clear the invalid output using input.next();, so that added onto the complications. 

Other than the problems stated above, it wasn't too hard of a program to make, I just had to do a lot of playing around with statements I haven't learned yet.
